# Congrats! This is a great start of your git adventure
The only way to get better at git is to keep on using it, no matter how nonsensical and basic the git that you are going to *repeatedly* use, just keep using it and you'll be a better git user. *It will all pay off later on and you will be happy you started early on this*

# What's the Next Step?
Try to 'pull' my new updates into your repository, then into your local!

You can continue playing around this repository (and your fork!) to be more familiar with git!. I will keep this repository updated and alive, so *keep those pull requests comin*

I suggest looking at this website and try all of the commands and play with them! (breaking git is part of the fun too if ever you *do break* some of it)

### p.s. if a git concept gets too complicated to understand (i.e. merge conflict, branches, etc.), know them by how you are going to use them ✔✔
